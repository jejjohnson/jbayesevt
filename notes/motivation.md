We know:
- The climate is changing --> we have observations and climate projections
- why the climate is changing --> anthropogenic activity
- one affect of climate change --> more frequent extreme events.

However, we want to know:
- What...? When...? How...?
- Can we predict (anticipate the frequency) of extreme events?
- Human Risk assessment --> hobsow?

**How ongoing climate change affects the frequency and intensity of the extreme events**.

--> Can we attribute specific covariates to extreme events.

### Why Do We Care?

**TLDR**: We care because extreme events on Earth impact humans directly.

**Weather & Climate Variables**:

> Mainly understanding how individual

- Temperature
- Climate
- Wind


**Phenomena**

> Quantifying changes in phenomena in the natural world

- Quantifying monsoons
- El NiÃ±o and other modes of variability
- Quantify poleward/equatorward extremes in jet positioning
- 

**Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment**

> The adverse affects on the human population

- Quantifying daily maximum concentrations of a harmful chemical species
- Extreme precipitation can lead flooding either directly or via streamflows.
- Extreme windstorms and/or tropical cyclone intensity can lead to infrastructure damage
- Extreme heat waves or cold snaps can lead to high prices or harm done to infrastructure. 
- Drought can cause damage to the agriculture industry which is very vulnerable to prolonged periods of extreme temperatures.
