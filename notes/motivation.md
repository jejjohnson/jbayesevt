We know:
- The climate is changing --> we have observations and climate projections
- why the climate is changing --> anthropogenic activity
- one affect of climate change --> more frequent extreme events.

However, we want to know:
- What...? When...? How...?
- Can we predict (anticipate the frequency) of extreme events?
- Human Risk assessment --> hobsow?

**How ongoing climate change affects the frequency and intensity of the extreme events**.

--> Can we attribute specific covariates to extreme events.

### Why Do We Care?

**TLDR**: We care because extreme events on Earth impact humans directly.

**Weather & Climate Variables**:

> Mainly understanding how individual

- Temperature
- Climate
- Wind


**Phenomena**

> Quantifying changes in phenomena in the natural world.
> Many of them are convective extremes, i.e., High Winds, Flash Flooding, Lightning, Tornados, Giant Hail and Land Slides.

- Quantifying monsoons
- El NiÃ±o and other modes of variability
- Quantify poleward/equatorward extremes in jet positioning
- 

**Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment**

> The adverse affects on the human population

- Quantifying daily maximum concentrations of a harmful chemical species
- Extreme precipitation can lead flooding either directly or via streamflows.
- Extreme windstorms and/or tropical cyclone intensity can lead to infrastructure damage
- Extreme heat waves or cold snaps can lead to high prices or harm done to infrastructure. 
- Drought can cause damage to the agriculture industry which is very vulnerable to prolonged periods of extreme temperatures.

A figure showcasing how the location, scale and shape correspond to different distribution shapes. For example, 1) the location parameter can represent the location shifts in maxima, 2) the scale parameter can demonstrate the scale shift in maxima which represents the change in variability, and 3) the shape parameter can demonstrate the distribution shape change which represents a change in symmetry.

### How Can We Understand?

**Physical Understanding**. 
Our knowledge of the physics and causal relationships between variables will be the greatest tool when it comes to understanding extremes.
For example, we have a lot of knowledge about climate change and the Greenhouse Gas Effect which could be causes to many different types of extreme events.

**Simulations**.
We encode this physical knowledge into computer code which reflect our understanding. From this, we can run simulations under different conditions to see *what would happen if...?*
For example, we can run simulations with and without different forcing scenarios.
See [my datasets guide](./data/datasets) for more details where I outline some available climate simulations.
