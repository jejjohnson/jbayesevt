# Bayesian Extreme Values Modeling for Climate (WIP)

> This repo will showcase how we can use some modern PPLs to model extreme values for climate data.
> We will also investigate how we can extend the standard models for EVTs which include spatial and/or temporal considerations.


## Installation (TODO)
